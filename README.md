# United States Web Design System (USWDS)
The [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) includes a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.


## USWDS Background

USWDS components and style guide follow industry-standard accessibility guidelines and use the best practices of existing style libraries and modern web design. The [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) created USWDS for designers and developers. USWDS is a project of GSA’s [Technology Transformation Service](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services), maintained by the Office of Products and Programs. They are designed for use by government product teams who want to create beautiful, easy-to-use online experiences for the public. To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/) and to view websites and applications check out our list [here](docs/WHO_IS_USING_USWDS.md).


## Reuse of open-source style guides

Much of the guidance in USWDS leans on open source designs, code, and patterns from other civic and government organizations, including:

- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)
- U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s [Design Patterns](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/)
- Healthcare.gov [Style Guide](http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/)
- UK’s Government Digital Service’s [UI Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/)
